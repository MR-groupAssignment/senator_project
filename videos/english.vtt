00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:03.922 align:center line:90% position:50%
Welcome to the US Capitol.

2
00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:06.592 align:center line:90% position:50%
Until you can visit us in person,

3
00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.678 align:center line:90% position:50%
we're going to share with you
some of our favorite

4
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.179 align:center line:90% position:50%
aspects of a capital tour.

5
00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:14.727 align:center line:90% position:50%
Since 1800, Congress has met here
in Washington, DC

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.646 align:center line:90% position:50%
to represent the people
and make

7
00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:17.313 align:center line:90% position:50%
laws.

8
00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:19.441 align:center line:90% position:50%
Both the US House of Representatives

9
00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:21.569 align:center line:90% position:50%
and the US Senate share the building.

10
00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:24.906 align:center line:90% position:50%
The House is on the South side
of the building,

11
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.034 align:center line:90% position:50%
or the left from this vantage point,

12
00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:29.537 align:center line:90% position:50%
and the Senate is on the north side
of the building,

13
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.289 align:center line:90% position:50%
or the right from this angle,

14
00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:31.915 align:center line:90% position:50%
with

15
00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.668 align:center line:90% position:50%
the Rotunda in the middle
under the Capital Del.

16
00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:37.797 align:center line:90% position:50%
Notice the statue
on the top of the Capitol.

17
00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:40.133 align:center line:90% position:50%
Her name is Freedom,

18
00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:42.386 align:center line:90% position:50%
and we're going to see a model
of her up close

19
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.346 align:center line:90% position:50%
in the Capital Visitor

20
00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:43.888 align:center line:90% position:50%
Center.

21
00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:45.932 align:center line:90% position:50%
Come on, let's go inside.

22
00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:48.394 align:center line:90% position:50%
When you visit the capital,

23
00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:51.064 align:center line:90% position:50%
you enter through the
Capital Visitor Center.

24
00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:55.444 align:center line:90% position:50%
People from the US and around the world
not only come here for tours,

25
00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:56.946 align:center line:90% position:50%
but also for conferences

26
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.367 align:center line:90% position:50%
and meetings with members of Congress
on important issues.

27
00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:05.332 align:center line:90% position:50%
This room is named Emancipation Hall
to honor the enslaved people

28
00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:06.333 align:center line:90% position:50%
who work to build the

29
00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:06.834 align:center line:90% position:50%
capital.

30
00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:10.421 align:center line:90% position:50%
Beginning in 1793, statues
of Frederick Douglass,

31
00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:11.506 align:center line:90% position:50%
Sojourner Truth,

32
00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:13.050 align:center line:90% position:50%
and Sakagawa reflect

33
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.512 align:center line:90% position:50%
the diversity of the individuals
who helped shape our country's history.

34
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:19.600 align:center line:90% position:50%
Remember this statue
from the top of the Dome?

35
00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:21.936 align:center line:90% position:50%
This is the original plaster model

36
00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.647 align:center line:90% position:50%
that was used to create
the bronze statue of Freedom.

37
00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.945 align:center line:90% position:50%
It was designed by an American artist
named Thomas Crawford

38
00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.113 align:center line:90% position:50%
who had this model shipped

39
00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:32.991 align:center line:90% position:50%
to Washington DC all the way
from Italy.

40
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.330 align:center line:90% position:50%
The entire statue
is 19.5 feet tall.

41
00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.001 align:center line:90% position:50%
Freedom is dressed
in a classic Greco-roman style

42
00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:43.045 align:center line:90% position:50%
to match the architecture of the building.

43
00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:46.925 align:center line:90% position:50%
She also wears a helmet topped
with an eagle plumed Crest

44
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.636 align:center line:90% position:50%
and carries a sword, shield

45
00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.720 align:center line:90% position:50%
and Laurel wreath.

46
00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:57.397 align:center line:90% position:50%
The first place we're going inside
the historic capitol building

47
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.523 align:center line:90% position:50%
is the crypt.

48
00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:01.277 align:center line:90% position:50%
The crypt is not the fanciest room
in the capital,

49
00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:03.112 align:center line:90% position:50%
but it has an important job.

50
00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:07.117 align:center line:90% position:50%
The arches and the 40 large columns
not only hold up the ceiling,

51
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.328 align:center line:90% position:50%
but also the Â£8.9 million

52
00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.831 align:center line:90% position:50%
Dome you saw from the outside.

53
00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:14.043 align:center line:90% position:50%
The weight of the Dome
in the Rotunda,

54
00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:15.378 align:center line:90% position:50%
which we'll visit shortly,

55
00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:16.421 align:center line:90% position:50%
sits on the walls,

56
00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.882 align:center line:90% position:50%
and the arches carry that weight
to the columns

57
00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.801 align:center line:90% position:50%
so that everything is supported.

58
00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:23.137 align:center line:90% position:50%
There's a lot
of engineering in there.

59
00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:27.142 align:center line:90% position:50%
And remember, in the 1800s
they did all of this

60
00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:29.687 align:center line:90% position:50%
without power tools
or modern construction

61
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:30.438 align:center line:90% position:50%
equipment.

62
00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:34.068 align:center line:90% position:50%
You can still see the tool marks
on one of the columns.

63
00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:38.490 align:center line:90% position:50%
Imagine all of the work it took just
to make one of these with hand tools.

64
00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:42.328 align:center line:90% position:50%
When Pierre L'enfant designed
the city of Washington,

65
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:43.830 align:center line:90% position:50%
he put the Capitol building in

66
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:45.332 align:center line:90% position:50%
the center of his design.

67
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.377 align:center line:90% position:50%
The star in the crypt marks the place

68
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:51.005 align:center line:90% position:50%
where the four quadrants
of the city come together.

69
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.844 align:center line:90% position:50%
We have a lot of statues
in the capital.

70
00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:58.014 align:center line:90% position:50%
The crypt in particular has one statue

71
00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:00.726 align:center line:90% position:50%
from each of the 13 original colonies.

72
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.980 align:center line:90% position:50%
This is a statue
of Roger Sherman from Connecticut,

73
00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:05.607 align:center line:90% position:50%
along with Oliver Ellsworth.

74
00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.611 align:center line:90% position:50%
Roger Sherman is the author
of The Great Compromise,

75
00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:10.446 align:center line:90% position:50%
which is the part of the Constitution

76
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.617 align:center line:90% position:50%
that laid out the ways in which Congress
represents the people.

77
00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:15.870 align:center line:90% position:50%
Now let's go upstairs
to see the Rotunda,

78
00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:17.956 align:center line:90% position:50%
the room directly Under the Dome.

79
00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.169 align:center line:90% position:50%
The Rotunda is the ceremonial
center of the capital.

80
00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:26.508 align:center line:90% position:50%
Over the years, we've used this room
to share our history,

81
00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:28.010 align:center line:90% position:50%
unveil new art,

82
00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:29.178 align:center line:90% position:50%
honor those

83
00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:31.681 align:center line:90% position:50%
who've made significant contributions.

84
00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.810 align:center line:90% position:50%
And to say goodbye
to national leaders

85
00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:38.064 align:center line:90% position:50%
and citizens who have served
our country during

86
00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:38.940 align:center line:90% position:50%
the Civil War.

87
00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:42.278 align:center line:90% position:50%
We even use this room as a hospital
for wounded soldiers.

88
00:03:42.403 --> 00:03:44.739 align:center line:90% position:50%
The room is decorated with art.

89
00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.868 align:center line:90% position:50%
Above us, in the eye
of the Rotunda,

90
00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:49.954 align:center line:90% position:50%
is the apotheosis of Washington.

91
00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:51.873 align:center line:90% position:50%
It is a fresco,

92
00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:55.294 align:center line:90% position:50%
which means that it was painted
onto the ceiling over wet plaster.

93
00:03:55.711 --> 00:04:01.093 align:center line:90% position:50%
The entire painting is huge,
4664 square feet.

94
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.513 align:center line:90% position:50%
The artist Constantino Brumidi

95
00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:07.518 align:center line:90% position:50%
had to climb 180 feet up
inside the Dome to paint it.

96
00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:11.815 align:center line:90% position:50%
The word apotheosis means
that you've reached the highest height,

97
00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:12.691 align:center line:90% position:50%
and in the middle of

98
00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:16.112 align:center line:90% position:50%
the painting is George Washington
surrounded by women.

99
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.908 align:center line:90% position:50%
13 of which represent
the 13 original colonies.

100
00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:21.911 align:center line:90% position:50%
Also in the painting are scenes

101
00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:24.122 align:center line:90% position:50%
representing 6 different themes,

102
00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:25.874 align:center line:90% position:50%
war, science.

103
00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:29.754 align:center line:90% position:50%
Marine commerce, mechanics

104
00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:35.219 align:center line:90% position:50%
and agriculture symbolized
by Roman gods and goddesses.

105
00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:37.972 align:center line:90% position:50%
Much of the artwork in the capital

106
00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:40.058 align:center line:90% position:50%
reflects the history of the country.

107
00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:43.479 align:center line:90% position:50%
Some of these may even
be familiar to you.

108
00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:47.609 align:center line:90% position:50%
This painting by John Trumbull
is the presentation of the Declaration

109
00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:48.569 align:center line:90% position:50%
of Independence,

110
00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:50.446 align:center line:90% position:50%
which appears in a lot of textbooks

111
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.491 align:center line:90% position:50%
and even on the back
of the $2.00 bill.

112
00:04:52.824 --> 00:04:56.746 align:center line:90% position:50%
Each piece of art tells a story
the American Revolution,

113
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:59.082 align:center line:90% position:50%
the Civil War, stories of peace,

114
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.753 align:center line:90% position:50%
stories of struggle,
stories of America.

115
00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:06.008 align:center line:90% position:50%
But while we're touring the capital,

116
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:08.552 align:center line:90% position:50%
the work of Congress
is going on around us.

117
00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.473 align:center line:90% position:50%
We may be talking about the past,

118
00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:14.018 align:center line:90% position:50%
but the future of our country
is being decided here

119
00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:14.602 align:center line:90% position:50%
today.

120
00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:17.146 align:center line:90% position:50%
Let's walk next door.

121
00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:21.527 align:center line:90% position:50%
This is Statuary Hall.

122
00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:23.905 align:center line:90% position:50%
Before it was a room filled
with statues.

123
00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:26.658 align:center line:90% position:50%
It functioned as the House
of Representatives chamber

124
00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:29.787 align:center line:90% position:50%
from 1807 to 1857.

125
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.916 align:center line:90% position:50%
This was one of the rooms
where Congress made laws.

126
00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:37.255 align:center line:90% position:50%
As the country grew in size,

127
00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:39.216 align:center line:90% position:50%
Congress added members to the House

128
00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:40.676 align:center line:90% position:50%
and the Senate to represent

129
00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.680 align:center line:90% position:50%
the new States and the greater
population of the country.

130
00:05:44.764 --> 00:05:47.101 align:center line:90% position:50%
The Capitol building
had to grow as well,

131
00:05:47.184 --> 00:05:49.437 align:center line:90% position:50%
and today the House of
Representatives works

132
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.314 align:center line:90% position:50%
in a larger chamber
down the hall.

133
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.984 align:center line:90% position:50%
Today we recognize some of the people

134
00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:55.861 align:center line:90% position:50%
who were members of the House
in this room

135
00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:56.487 align:center line:90% position:50%
by marking

136
00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.156 align:center line:90% position:50%
their old desk locations.

137
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.744 align:center line:90% position:50%
Eight of them, including Abraham Lincoln
and John Quincy Adams,

138
00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:02.829 align:center line:90% position:50%
became Presidents of

139
00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:03.997 align:center line:90% position:50%
the United States.

140
00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:07.251 align:center line:90% position:50%
We've marked their desk locations
with plaques on the floor.

141
00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:10.547 align:center line:90% position:50%
Congress turned the old Hall of the House

142
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.883 align:center line:90% position:50%
into National Statuary Hall in 1864.

143
00:06:15.094 --> 00:06:17.972 align:center line:90% position:50%
Statues are chosen
by the state legislatures.

144
00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:22.186 align:center line:90% position:50%
Each state can send statues
of two people from its history.

145
00:06:23.187 --> 00:06:25.482 align:center line:90% position:50%
Some of the state statues
that are in this room today

146
00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:26.984 align:center line:90% position:50%
depict people who are members of

147
00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:29.445 align:center line:90% position:50%
the House when this room
was the House chamber.

148
00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:33.450 align:center line:90% position:50%
For example, Kentucky sent
a statue of Henry Clay,

149
00:06:33.534 --> 00:06:34.952 align:center line:90% position:50%
who was the youngest speaker of the

150
00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:35.494 align:center line:90% position:50%
House.

151
00:06:36.955 --> 00:06:40.167 align:center line:90% position:50%
But states haven't just sent statues
of members of Congress.

152
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.004 align:center line:90% position:50%
One of the newer statues
in the collection

153
00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:45.090 align:center line:90% position:50%
is Chief Standing Bear from Nebraska.

154
00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:48.552 align:center line:90% position:50%
He was a leader of the Ponca tribe

155
00:06:48.844 --> 00:06:51.973 align:center line:90% position:50%
when his people were forced to move
to Oklahoma to a reservation.

156
00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:55.060 align:center line:90% position:50%
He argued successfully
for the rights of his people.

157
00:06:56.312 --> 00:06:58.857 align:center line:90% position:50%
Here's a statue of the inventor
Thomas Edison.

158
00:06:59.775 --> 00:07:01.819 align:center line:90% position:50%
The state of Ohio sent this one.

159
00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:03.947 align:center line:90% position:50%
There is also a statue

160
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.574 align:center line:90% position:50%
that is not a state statue

161
00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:07.701 align:center line:90% position:50%
but is a gift from Congress
to all

162
00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:11.206 align:center line:90% position:50%
of us, and that is the one
of the iconic civil rights leader

163
00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:12.958 align:center line:90% position:50%
Rosa Parks, a woman who

164
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:16.045 align:center line:90% position:50%
risked her life in the fight
against segregation.

165
00:07:19.716 --> 00:07:21.761 align:center line:90% position:50%
When this room became Statuary Hall,

166
00:07:21.844 --> 00:07:23.805 align:center line:90% position:50%
they thought that all of the state statues
would

167
00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:27.226 align:center line:90% position:50%
be placed here, but that was before
we had 50 states.

168
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.939 align:center line:90% position:50%
Statues started arriving
in the capital in 1870,

169
00:07:31.022 --> 00:07:33.734 align:center line:90% position:50%
but in the 1930s
the collection outgrew

170
00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:34.777 align:center line:90% position:50%
Statuary Hall,

171
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.363 align:center line:90% position:50%
and for both aesthetic
and structural reasons,

172
00:07:37.447 --> 00:07:38.615 align:center line:90% position:50%
Congress authorized the

173
00:07:38.698 --> 00:07:40.784 align:center line:90% position:50%
display of statues
throughout the building.

174
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:44.289 align:center line:90% position:50%
Here are a few of the statues
you can find in Emancipation Hall,

175
00:07:44.372 --> 00:07:45.749 align:center line:90% position:50%
where we started our

176
00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:46.291 align:center line:90% position:50%
tour.

177
00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:50.296 align:center line:90% position:50%
This is Montana's statue
of Jeanette Rankin.

178
00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:52.132 align:center line:90% position:50%
The first woman elected to the House
of Representatives.

179
00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:55.052 align:center line:90% position:50%
New Mexico sent this statue of Pope,

180
00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:57.180 align:center line:90% position:50%
one of the leaders of the Pueblo Indians,

181
00:07:57.263 --> 00:07:57.388 align:center line:90% position:50%
in the

182
00:07:57.472 --> 00:07:57.847 align:center line:90% position:50%
1600s.

183
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.895 align:center line:90% position:50%
Alabama sent the statue
of Helen Keller.

184
00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:05.232 align:center line:90% position:50%
Miss Keller, as an adult,

185
00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:08.110 align:center line:90% position:50%
advocated for the rights
of people with disabilities.

186
00:08:09.403 --> 00:08:13.367 align:center line:90% position:50%
She was both deaf and blind
in this statue of her as a girl.

187
00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.035 align:center line:90% position:50%
The artist captured the moment

188
00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:18.081 align:center line:90% position:50%
when she learned how to communicate
the word for water.

189
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.461 align:center line:90% position:50%
The capital is unlike any other place
you will visit.

190
00:08:23.254 --> 00:08:25.632 align:center line:90% position:50%
It's the center of American government,

191
00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:28.093 align:center line:90% position:50%
but it's also a witness to history

192
00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:28.761 align:center line:90% position:50%
and a symbol

193
00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:29.804 align:center line:90% position:50%
of democracy.

194
00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:32.265 align:center line:90% position:50%
A place where we tell the stories

195
00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:35.102 align:center line:90% position:50%
of what it means to be
a citizen of the United States.

196
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:38.899 align:center line:90% position:50%
The building where the people
are represented by Congress.

197
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:43.154 align:center line:90% position:50%
We're happy that you took the time
to come on a brief tour with us,

198
00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:43.988 align:center line:90% position:50%
and we hope that

199
00:08:44.072 --> 00:08:47.326 align:center line:90% position:50%
you have been as inspired
by what you've seen as we are.

200
00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:48.327 align:center line:90% position:50%
Every day.

201
00:08:49.453 --> 00:08:50.622 align:center line:90% position:50%
When you're able to visit,

202
00:08:50.705 --> 00:08:54.501 align:center line:90% position:50%
we'll be here to welcome you
to the United States Capitol.
