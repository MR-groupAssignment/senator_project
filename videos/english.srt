1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:03,922
{\an2}Welcome to the US Capitol.

2
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:06,592
{\an2}Until you can visit us in person,

3
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,678
{\an2}we're going to share with you
{\an2}some of our favorite

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,179
{\an2}aspects of a capital tour.

5
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:14,727
{\an2}Since 1800, Congress has met here
{\an2}in Washington, DC

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,646
{\an2}to represent the people
{\an2}and make

7
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,313
{\an2}laws.

8
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,441
{\an2}Both the US House of Representatives

9
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,569
{\an2}and the US Senate share the building.

10
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,906
{\an2}The House is on the South side
{\an2}of the building,

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,034
{\an2}or the left from this vantage point,

12
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:29,537
{\an2}and the Senate is on the north side
{\an2}of the building,

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,289
{\an2}or the right from this angle,

14
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:31,915
{\an2}with

15
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,668
{\an2}the Rotunda in the middle
{\an2}under the Capital Del.

16
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,797
{\an2}Notice the statue
{\an2}on the top of the Capitol.

17
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,133
{\an2}Her name is Freedom,

18
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:42,386
{\an2}and we're going to see a model
{\an2}of her up close

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,346
{\an2}in the Capital Visitor

20
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:43,888
{\an2}Center.

21
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:45,932
{\an2}Come on, let's go inside.

22
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:48,394
{\an2}When you visit the capital,

23
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:51,064
{\an2}you enter through the
{\an2}Capital Visitor Center.

24
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:55,444
{\an2}People from the US and around the world
{\an2}not only come here for tours,

25
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:56,946
{\an2}but also for conferences

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,367
{\an2}and meetings with members of Congress
{\an2}on important issues.

27
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:05,332
{\an2}This room is named Emancipation Hall
{\an2}to honor the enslaved people

28
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,333
{\an2}who work to build the

29
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:06,834
{\an2}capital.

30
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:10,421
{\an2}Beginning in 1793, statues
{\an2}of Frederick Douglass,

31
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:11,506
{\an2}Sojourner Truth,

32
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,050
{\an2}and Sakagawa reflect

33
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:16,512
{\an2}the diversity of the individuals
{\an2}who helped shape our country's history.

34
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,600
{\an2}Remember this statue
{\an2}from the top of the Dome?

35
00:01:19,808 --> 00:01:21,936
{\an2}This is the original plaster model

36
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:24,647
{\an2}that was used to create
{\an2}the bronze statue of Freedom.

37
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:28,945
{\an2}It was designed by an American artist
{\an2}named Thomas Crawford

38
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,113
{\an2}who had this model shipped

39
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:32,991
{\an2}to Washington DC all the way
{\an2}from Italy.

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,330
{\an2}The entire statue
{\an2}is 19.5 feet tall.

41
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,001
{\an2}Freedom is dressed
{\an2}in a classic Greco-roman style

42
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,045
{\an2}to match the architecture of the building.

43
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,925
{\an2}She also wears a helmet topped
{\an2}with an eagle plumed Crest

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,636
{\an2}and carries a sword, shield

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,720
{\an2}and Laurel wreath.

46
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:57,397
{\an2}The first place we're going inside
{\an2}the historic capitol building

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,523
{\an2}is the crypt.

48
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:01,277
{\an2}The crypt is not the fanciest room
{\an2}in the capital,

49
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:03,112
{\an2}but it has an important job.

50
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:07,117
{\an2}The arches and the 40 large columns
{\an2}not only hold up the ceiling,

51
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,328
{\an2}but also the Â£8.9 million

52
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,831
{\an2}Dome you saw from the outside.

53
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:14,043
{\an2}The weight of the Dome
{\an2}in the Rotunda,

54
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:15,378
{\an2}which we'll visit shortly,

55
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,421
{\an2}sits on the walls,

56
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,882
{\an2}and the arches carry that weight
{\an2}to the columns

57
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,801
{\an2}so that everything is supported.

58
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:23,137
{\an2}There's a lot
{\an2}of engineering in there.

59
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:27,142
{\an2}And remember, in the 1800s
{\an2}they did all of this

60
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:29,687
{\an2}without power tools
{\an2}or modern construction

61
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:30,438
{\an2}equipment.

62
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:34,068
{\an2}You can still see the tool marks
{\an2}on one of the columns.

63
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:38,490
{\an2}Imagine all of the work it took just
{\an2}to make one of these with hand tools.

64
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:42,328
{\an2}When Pierre L'enfant designed
{\an2}the city of Washington,

65
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:43,830
{\an2}he put the Capitol building in

66
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,332
{\an2}the center of his design.

67
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,377
{\an2}The star in the crypt marks the place

68
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,005
{\an2}where the four quadrants
{\an2}of the city come together.

69
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,844
{\an2}We have a lot of statues
{\an2}in the capital.

70
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,014
{\an2}The crypt in particular has one statue

71
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:00,726
{\an2}from each of the 13 original colonies.

72
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,980
{\an2}This is a statue
{\an2}of Roger Sherman from Connecticut,

73
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,607
{\an2}along with Oliver Ellsworth.

74
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:08,611
{\an2}Roger Sherman is the author
{\an2}of The Great Compromise,

75
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:10,446
{\an2}which is the part of the Constitution

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,617
{\an2}that laid out the ways in which Congress
{\an2}represents the people.

77
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:15,870
{\an2}Now let's go upstairs
{\an2}to see the Rotunda,

78
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:17,956
{\an2}the room directly Under the Dome.

79
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,169
{\an2}The Rotunda is the ceremonial
{\an2}center of the capital.

80
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:26,508
{\an2}Over the years, we've used this room
{\an2}to share our history,

81
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:28,010
{\an2}unveil new art,

82
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:29,178
{\an2}honor those

83
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,681
{\an2}who've made significant contributions.

84
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,810
{\an2}And to say goodbye
{\an2}to national leaders

85
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:38,064
{\an2}and citizens who have served
{\an2}our country during

86
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:38,940
{\an2}the Civil War.

87
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:42,278
{\an2}We even use this room as a hospital
{\an2}for wounded soldiers.

88
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,739
{\an2}The room is decorated with art.

89
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,868
{\an2}Above us, in the eye
{\an2}of the Rotunda,

90
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:49,954
{\an2}is the apotheosis of Washington.

91
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:51,873
{\an2}It is a fresco,

92
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:55,294
{\an2}which means that it was painted
{\an2}onto the ceiling over wet plaster.

93
00:03:55,711 --> 00:04:01,093
{\an2}The entire painting is huge,
{\an2}4664 square feet.

94
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,513
{\an2}The artist Constantino Brumidi

95
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:07,518
{\an2}had to climb 180 feet up
{\an2}inside the Dome to paint it.

96
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,815
{\an2}The word apotheosis means
{\an2}that you've reached the highest height,

97
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:12,691
{\an2}and in the middle of

98
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:16,112
{\an2}the painting is George Washington
{\an2}surrounded by women.

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,908
{\an2}13 of which represent
{\an2}the 13 original colonies.

100
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,911
{\an2}Also in the painting are scenes

101
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:24,122
{\an2}representing 6 different themes,

102
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,874
{\an2}war, science.

103
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,754
{\an2}Marine commerce, mechanics

104
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:35,219
{\an2}and agriculture symbolized
{\an2}by Roman gods and goddesses.

105
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:37,972
{\an2}Much of the artwork in the capital

106
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,058
{\an2}reflects the history of the country.

107
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,479
{\an2}Some of these may even
{\an2}be familiar to you.

108
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:47,609
{\an2}This painting by John Trumbull
{\an2}is the presentation of the Declaration

109
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:48,569
{\an2}of Independence,

110
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,446
{\an2}which appears in a lot of textbooks

111
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,491
{\an2}and even on the back
{\an2}of the $2.00 bill.

112
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:56,746
{\an2}Each piece of art tells a story
{\an2}the American Revolution,

113
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:59,082
{\an2}the Civil War, stories of peace,

114
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,753
{\an2}stories of struggle,
{\an2}stories of America.

115
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,008
{\an2}But while we're touring the capital,

116
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:08,552
{\an2}the work of Congress
{\an2}is going on around us.

117
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,473
{\an2}We may be talking about the past,

118
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,018
{\an2}but the future of our country
{\an2}is being decided here

119
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:14,602
{\an2}today.

120
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:17,146
{\an2}Let's walk next door.

121
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,527
{\an2}This is Statuary Hall.

122
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,905
{\an2}Before it was a room filled
{\an2}with statues.

123
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,658
{\an2}It functioned as the House
{\an2}of Representatives chamber

124
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,787
{\an2}from 1807 to 1857.

125
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,916
{\an2}This was one of the rooms
{\an2}where Congress made laws.

126
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,255
{\an2}As the country grew in size,

127
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,216
{\an2}Congress added members to the House

128
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:40,676
{\an2}and the Senate to represent

129
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,680
{\an2}the new States and the greater
{\an2}population of the country.

130
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:47,101
{\an2}The Capitol building
{\an2}had to grow as well,

131
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:49,437
{\an2}and today the House of
{\an2}Representatives works

132
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,314
{\an2}in a larger chamber
{\an2}down the hall.

133
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,984
{\an2}Today we recognize some of the people

134
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,861
{\an2}who were members of the House
{\an2}in this room

135
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:56,487
{\an2}by marking

136
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,156
{\an2}their old desk locations.

137
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,744
{\an2}Eight of them, including Abraham Lincoln
{\an2}and John Quincy Adams,

138
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:02,829
{\an2}became Presidents of

139
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:03,997
{\an2}the United States.

140
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:07,251
{\an2}We've marked their desk locations
{\an2}with plaques on the floor.

141
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,547
{\an2}Congress turned the old Hall of the House

142
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,883
{\an2}into National Statuary Hall in 1864.

143
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:17,972
{\an2}Statues are chosen
{\an2}by the state legislatures.

144
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:22,186
{\an2}Each state can send statues
{\an2}of two people from its history.

145
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,482
{\an2}Some of the state statues
{\an2}that are in this room today

146
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,984
{\an2}depict people who are members of

147
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,445
{\an2}the House when this room
{\an2}was the House chamber.

148
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:33,450
{\an2}For example, Kentucky sent
{\an2}a statue of Henry Clay,

149
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,952
{\an2}who was the youngest speaker of the

150
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:35,494
{\an2}House.

151
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:40,167
{\an2}But states haven't just sent statues
{\an2}of members of Congress.

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,004
{\an2}One of the newer statues
{\an2}in the collection

153
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,090
{\an2}is Chief Standing Bear from Nebraska.

154
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,552
{\an2}He was a leader of the Ponca tribe

155
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,973
{\an2}when his people were forced to move
{\an2}to Oklahoma to a reservation.

156
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:55,060
{\an2}He argued successfully
{\an2}for the rights of his people.

157
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,857
{\an2}Here's a statue of the inventor
{\an2}Thomas Edison.

158
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:01,819
{\an2}The state of Ohio sent this one.

159
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:03,947
{\an2}There is also a statue

160
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,574
{\an2}that is not a state statue

161
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:07,701
{\an2}but is a gift from Congress
{\an2}to all

162
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:11,206
{\an2}of us, and that is the one
{\an2}of the iconic civil rights leader

163
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:12,958
{\an2}Rosa Parks, a woman who

164
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,045
{\an2}risked her life in the fight
{\an2}against segregation.

165
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:21,761
{\an2}When this room became Statuary Hall,

166
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,805
{\an2}they thought that all of the state statues
{\an2}would

167
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:27,226
{\an2}be placed here, but that was before
{\an2}we had 50 states.

168
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,939
{\an2}Statues started arriving
{\an2}in the capital in 1870,

169
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:33,734
{\an2}but in the 1930s
{\an2}the collection outgrew

170
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:34,777
{\an2}Statuary Hall,

171
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,363
{\an2}and for both aesthetic
{\an2}and structural reasons,

172
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,615
{\an2}Congress authorized the

173
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,784
{\an2}display of statues
{\an2}throughout the building.

174
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,289
{\an2}Here are a few of the statues
{\an2}you can find in Emancipation Hall,

175
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:45,749
{\an2}where we started our

176
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,291
{\an2}tour.

177
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,296
{\an2}This is Montana's statue
{\an2}of Jeanette Rankin.

178
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,132
{\an2}The first woman elected to the House
{\an2}of Representatives.

179
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,052
{\an2}New Mexico sent this statue of Pope,

180
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,180
{\an2}one of the leaders of the Pueblo Indians,

181
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:57,388
{\an2}in the

182
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:57,847
{\an2}1600s.

183
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,895
{\an2}Alabama sent the statue
{\an2}of Helen Keller.

184
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,232
{\an2}Miss Keller, as an adult,

185
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:08,110
{\an2}advocated for the rights
{\an2}of people with disabilities.

186
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:13,367
{\an2}She was both deaf and blind
{\an2}in this statue of her as a girl.

187
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,035
{\an2}The artist captured the moment

188
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,081
{\an2}when she learned how to communicate
{\an2}the word for water.

189
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,461
{\an2}The capital is unlike any other place
{\an2}you will visit.

190
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,632
{\an2}It's the center of American government,

191
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,093
{\an2}but it's also a witness to history

192
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:28,761
{\an2}and a symbol

193
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:29,804
{\an2}of democracy.

194
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:32,265
{\an2}A place where we tell the stories

195
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,102
{\an2}of what it means to be
{\an2}a citizen of the United States.

196
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,899
{\an2}The building where the people
{\an2}are represented by Congress.

197
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:43,154
{\an2}We're happy that you took the time
{\an2}to come on a brief tour with us,

198
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,988
{\an2}and we hope that

199
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:47,326
{\an2}you have been as inspired
{\an2}by what you've seen as we are.

200
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,327
{\an2}Every day.

201
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:50,622
{\an2}When you're able to visit,

202
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:54,501
{\an2}we'll be here to welcome you
{\an2}to the United States Capitol.
