This website is created to display the data which is read from the senators.json file provided beforehand.

A navigation bar is provided at the top of the website which directly leads to different sections of the page. Also, clicking on the heading  opens up the us goverment website.

We have included a video with subtitles which gives a brief about US capitol.

To display the count of representatives from different parties, we have used images along with animation implemented using css. Upon hovering on the images, it will show the number of representatives per party.

In order to display leaders of each party in an orderly fashion, we had created tabs with the help of html, css and javascript knowledge.

Three filters namely party, state and rank have been created to filter out the results in the table containing information about each senator. These filters are set to "show all" by default. 

Each table row in the table is clickable and upon clicking show all the information related to the senator in a window.

At the end, we have given some information about ourselves and some links to our social media profile.
